## Section A

<br>

### Question 1

Siying works as a wedding photographer and has been asked to take pictures of a wedding in Singapore. If she accepts the contract her commission will be £750. It costs £450 for her to reach the location, but the groom would reimburse her travel expenses. If she decides not to accept, she is going to direct a photoshoot for a local band and be paid £400. Given this information what should Siying do?

**a) Siying’s opportunity cost if she accepts the wedding photoshoot is £400 so she should go to Singapore and take pictures at the wedding.** <br>
*b) Siying’s opportunity cost if she accepts the wedding photoshoot is £300 so she should work with the local band.  <br>
c) Siying’s opportunity cost if she accepts the photoshoot with the local band is £300 so she should work with the local band.  <br>
d) Siying’s opportunity cost if she accepts the photoshoot with the local band is £400 so she should go to Singapore and take pictures at the wedding. <br>*

> a) The opportunity cost of Wedding photoshoot is the missed Local Band photoshoot which pays only £400, and thus she should accept the Wedding offer for £750.

> **The opportunity cost of an action is the best foregone alternative.**

<br>

### Question 2

Figure 1 shows the average total cost and marginal cost of a firm that produces output $q$. What can we infer from the figure?

![Figure 1](<Figures\EC1002_1022_Q2.png>)

*a) The firm will produce at the intersection between the marginal cost curve and the average total cost curve.  <br>
b) The firm incurs no fixed cost.  <br>*
**c) The firm incurs a positive fixed cost.** <br>
*d) The firm experiences increasing returns to scale at any level of output. <br>*

> c) The ATC Curve is greater than the MC Curve at its starting point, indicating the presence of fixed costs.

<br>

### Question 3

In which way are the Grant Museum of Zoology (a small London museum that does not charge for entrance) and the atmosphere similar?

*a) They are both excludable.  <br>*
**b) They are both non-excludable.**  <br>
*c) They are both rival.  <br>
d) They are both non-rival. <br>*

> - **Excludable Goods** - restricted to paying customers
> - **Non-Excludable Goods** - cannot easily be restricted to paying customers
> - **Rival Goods** - can only be consumed by one individual at a time
> - **Non-Rival Goods** - can only be consumed by many individuals simultaneously without reducing availability to others

> b) The museum is free (so non-excludable) like the atmosphere but "small", so has limited capacity.

<br>

### Question 4

Which of the following statements is NOT correct when the labour market has a monopsony?

*a) The labour supply curve is upward sloping.  <br>
b) The amount of workers hired in a monopsony is lower than in a competitive market.  <br>
c) A monopsonist wishing to hire an extra worker will need to pay a higher wage to each of their workers.  <br>*
**d) Monopsonies are more likely to arise in big cities than in small towns. <br>**

> **Monopsonies - a market with one buyer**

> d) Monopsonies are more likely to arise in a small town with few or no employers than in a big city.

> *Labour supply curve is still upwards sloping, meaning marginal worker wage is an increasing function. In a monopsony, employers have a greater ability to supress wages, leading to lower employment.*

<br>

### Question 5

Harry and Ron are flatmates and each week they choose whether to clean the flat or not. This week Ron has invited Hermione for dinner, whereas Harry has an important match coming up so won’t be home much. Their payoffs from cleaning (or not) the flat this week are as follows:

| Ron/Harry    | Clean | Don’t clean |
|--------------|-------|-------------|
| Clean        | 14, 5 | 7, 6        |
| Don’t clean  | 8, 8  | 4, 6        |

Which of the following statements is correct?

*a) The pure strategy Nash equilibria are (clean, clean) and (don’t clean, don’t clean).  <br>
b) The unique pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (clean, clean).  <br>
c) The pure strategy Nash equilibria are (clean, don’t clean) and (don’t clean, don’t clean).* <br>
**d) The unique pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (clean, don’t clean).**

> *Ron is better off cleaning, irrespective of Harry's actions. Harry doesn't care what Ron does if he's not cleaning but he'd most rather clean alone, and least rather clean with Ron.*

> d) Clean / Don't Clean is the unique pure strategy Nash equilibrium.

> **A pure strategy Nash equilibrium is the intersection of best responses.**

<br>

### Question 6

Paying efficiency wages does not increase a firm's profit by:

*a) Decreasing the country’s natural unemployment rate.  <br>
b) Decreasing worker turnover and therefore decreasing hiring and training costs.  <br>
c) Increasing workers’ productivity.  <br>*
**d) Lowering efficiency in the market.**

> **Efficiency Wages** are above market rates intended to boost business efficiency by increasing productivity and reducing turnover.

> d) Efficiency wages do not lower efficiency in the market.

<br>

### Question 7

With perfect capital mobility, if inflation in the UK is forecasted to be 3% higher than in the US and interest parity holds, then:

*a) The UK will become more competitive than the US.  <br>
b) There will be opportunities for arbitrage.* <br>
**c) There will be a depreciation of the pound with respect to the dollar.  <br>**
*d) None of the above.*

> **Capiptal Mobility** - free flow of capital <br>
> **Interest Rate Parity** - difference in rates perfectly adjusts for expected changes in currency valuations (no-arbitrage condition)

> c) We should expect the currency of the country with the higher inflation to depreciate.

> *To maintain interest rate parity, UK interest rates will need to rise.*

<br>

### Question 8

Which of the following statements about the Brazilian balance of payments is correct?

*a) The current account does not measure the difference between payments for services manufactured in Brazil and exported to other countries and those manufactured in other countries and imported by Brazil. <br>*
**b) If all transactions are measured correctly the sum of the current account, capital account and financial account is zero.  <br>**
*c) The sale of a Brazilian financial asset would be recorded in the capital account.  <br>
d) The sale of Brazilian goods would be recorded in the financial account.*

> - **Current Account** measures flow of goods and services (Trade Balance), net factor income (earnings from investments), net current transfers (eg. remittances and foreign aid).
> - **Capital Account** records transactions relating to transfer of ownership of assets.
> - **Financial Account** records financial transactions that do not involve a change of ownership.

> b) $\text{Current Account } + \text{ Capital Account } + \text{ Financial Account }= 0$ as deficits / surpluses in the current account are offset by a surplus / deficit in the capital or financial accounts.


<br>

### Question 9

Which of the following statements about banking crises is correct?

*a) In a solvency crisis the assets of a bank are greater than its liabilities.*  <br>
**b) In a liquidity crisis the assets of a bank are greater than its liabilities.**  <br>
*c) A solvency crisis can be easily solved if the central bank lends more money to banks.  <br>
d) A liquidity crisis is always due to a bank run.*

> b) The bank should still be solvent (Assets > Liabilities) in a liquidity crisis.

<br>

### Question 10

Many western countries are experiencing a lower birth rate in recent years. If nothing else has changed what is a consequence of this decrease in population growth according to the Solow model?

*a) Lower investments at the steady state.  <br>
b) A higher saving rate.  <br>
c) A lower saving rate.* <br>
**d) Higher investments at the steady state.**

> d) Population decline would reduce workers and thus we would need more capital per worker to maintain the steady state.

## Section B

### Question 11

Chloe sets aside a budget of £100 for spending on fashion accessories (good $X$) and cosmetics (good $Y$), the prices of which are $P_X = 50$ and $P_Y = 25$, respectively. Chloe’s preferences over the two goods are described by the utility function $U(X,Y) = XY$, for which $MU_X = Y$ and $MU_Y = X$.

a) Explain how Chloe’s preferences can be translated into indifference curves. Sketch some of these in a diagram. Do her indifference curves touch the axes? [7 marks]  

b) Find the number of fashion accessories and cosmetics that Chloe chooses to consume and illustrate her choice in your diagram. [8 marks]  

c) Chloe invites her closest friends to celebrate her birthday and receives 8 fashion accessories as gifts, but no cosmetics. What is her utility gain from these gifts, assuming Chloe starts from the bundle in (b)? Add Chloe’s new bundle and corresponding indifference curve in your diagram. [5 marks]  

d) Analyse whether Chloe would be better off receiving a gift voucher equivalent in value to 8 fashion accessories, but which she can spend as she likes. Do you find this model a good description of the enjoyment from receiving birthday gifts? [10 marks]  

> **Indifference Curves represent combinations of goods resulting in equal utility.** 

![Indifference Curves](<Figures\EC1002_1022_Q11_Indifference.png>)

> Chloe's indifference curves are convex to the origin but never touch the axes since; $$ U = 0 \quad \forall \; X, \, Y \quad \text{if} \quad (Y = 0 \; \lor \; X = 0) $$ The 
Marginal rate of substitution is defined as; $$ MRS = \frac{MU_X}{MU_Y} = \frac{Y}{X} = \frac{P_X = £50}{P_Y = £25} = 2 \\~\\ Y = 2X $$

> **The optimal point is the point of tangency between the budget line (constraints) and the greatest indifference curve.**

![Optimization](<Figures\EC1002_1022_Q11_Optimization.png>)

> Given a budget of £100, Chloe should purchase 1 fashion accessory and 2 cosmetic items to achieve a utility of 2 units.

> Following the birthday party, Chloe will now have a total of 9 fashion accessories and 2 cosmetic items increasing her utility by 16 units to 18.

![Birthday Party](<Figures\EC1002_1022_Q11_Birthday_Party.png>)

> The new bundle is unoptimal, and thus Chloe could achieve greater utility from gift vouchers. $$ \begin{align}
U &= XY \nonumber \\
&= (1+X_{new})(2+Y_{new}) \nonumber \\
X_{new} = \frac{400 - 25Y_{new}}{50} \nonumber \\
&= ( \frac{450 -25Y_{new}}{50})(2+Y_{new}) \nonumber \\
&= \frac{1}{2}(18-Y_{new})(2+Y_{new}) \nonumber \\
&= \frac{1}{2}(36+16Y_{new}-Y_{new}^2) \nonumber \\\nonumber\\
U' &= 8-Y_{new} \nonumber \\
&= 0 \text{ when } Y_{new} = 8 \nonumber \\
\text{ for which } X_{new} = 4 \text{ and } U &= (1+4)(2+8) = 5 \times 10 = 50 \nonumber \\
\end{align} \\ $$
Thus, using gift vouchers, Chloe would instead buy 4 new fashion accessories and 8 new cosmetic items, bringing her total up to 5 and 10 respectively, with a total utility of 50 units, a 32 unit improvement. We cannot know how this improvement in utility compares to the lost sentimental value of presents chosen by friends.

### Question 12

There are many price-taking mozzarella cheese producers in Southern Italy. Each of them produces mozzarella of similar quality with identical production technology that gives rise to a U-shaped total average cost curve. There is free entry into and exit from the mozzarella cheese market and potential entrants can expect to produce mozzarella using the same technology as incumbent firms.

a) Draw a sketch of the cost curves of each mozzarella producer and explain why the supply curve of each producer is the marginal cost curve above average total cost in the long run. [8 marks]  

> The Marginal Cost curve represents the cost of producing an additional unit. The Average Total Cost curve represents the average cost of producing $q$ units. The ATC curve will trend towards the MC curve, with its minimum at the intersection point.

> Given that the market is perfectly competitive, the price will trend towards the minimum Average Total Cost ($ATC_{min}$) in the long run, where each firm produces an equal share of the aggregate quantity demanded. If demand goes down, some firms will exit the market, maintaining a constant price, reducing aggregate quantity supplied, allowing the remaining firms to produce at $ATC_{min}$. Firms would make losses otherwise. If demand goes up, existing firms will increase their supply while the price is greater than the marginal cost. Their profitability will attract new firms to join the market, and the market will trend back to equilibrium at $ATC_{min}$.

> Hence, the supply curve is undefined for quantities less than min(ATC) and equal to the MC curve beyond this.

![Supply](<Figures\EC1002_1022_Q12_Supply.png>)

b) The market price of mozzarella is observed to be higher than the minimum of average total cost. Can this be an equilibrium outcome in the short run? Can this be an equilibrium outcome in the long run? If yes, explain why; if not, identify the equilibrium outcome and explain how it will be reached. Support your answer with suitable diagrams. [15 marks]  

> Given the assumptions of free entry into and exit from
the mozzarella cheese market and no incumbent advantage, this equilibrium can only exist in the short run due to hysteresis.

c) The mozzarella producers realise that if they brand their product they will face their own downward sloping demand curve and can set their own price. Can they expect to be more profitable in the long-run if they differentiate their products through branding? Assume that branding does not impact their costs. [10 marks]  

> **Branding transforms the market structure from perfect competition to monopolistic competition.**

> Producers may increase the perceived utility of their mozarella through branding, pushing their own demand curve upwards. This will set the equilibrium above the $ATC_{min}$ allowing them to run their business profitably. 

> In the long run, the firm’s demand curve shifts downwards due to the entry of new firms, until it becomes tangent to the ATC curve, meaning profits are eroded.

## Section C

### Question 13

Utopia is founded as a simple economy with no government or international trade. Utopia’s economy is described by the following equations:

- Consumption: $ C = 20 + 0.8Y $
- Investment: $ I = 80 $

a) Sketch the Aggregate Demand (AD) schedule and find the multiplier and the equilibrium level of income in Utopia. [10 marks]  

> $ \begin{align} 
AD &= C + I \nonumber \\ 
&= 100+0.8Y \nonumber  \\ \nonumber \\
\text{at equilibrium } AD &= Y \nonumber \\
\text{so } Y &= 100+0.8Y \nonumber \\
Y &= \frac{100}{0.2} = 500 \nonumber \\ \end{align} \\~\\
\text{multiplier} = \frac{1}{1-c} = \frac{1}{1-0.8} = 5 \nonumber $

![Initial AD Schedule](<Figures\EC1002_1022_Q13a_AD.png>)

In due course Utopia forms a government, which enacts fiscal policy and opens the country to trade with neighbouring countries. The elected government introduces income tax $ t = 0.25 $ and spends $ G = 100 $, while signing a free trade agreement. The economy exports $30$, while the marginal propensity to import is $0.1$.

b) Find the new multiplier and the equilibrium level of income. Add the new AD curve to your sketch in (a) and comment on how the introduction of a government sector and trade has impacted the Utopian economy. [10 marks]  

> $ \begin{align} 
AD &= C + I +G \nonumber \\ 
&= 20 + 0.8(1-0.25)Y + 80 + 100 \nonumber \\ 
&= 200 + 0.6Y \nonumber \\ \nonumber \\ 
\text{at equilibrium } AD &= Y \nonumber \\
\text{so } Y &= 200+0.6Y \nonumber \\
Y &= \frac{200}{0.4} = 500 \nonumber \\ \end{align} \\~\\
\text{multiplier} = \frac{1}{1-c(1-t)+z} = \frac{1}{1-0.8(1-0.25)+0.1} = 2 \nonumber $

![Revised AD Schedule](<Figures\EC1002_1022_Q13b_AD.png>)

c) Find the budget deficit and trade balance in equilibrium. [5 marks]  

> $ \text{Tax Revenue } = 25\% \times 500 = 125 \\
\text{Government Spending } = 100 \\
\textbf{Budget Deficit } = 100 - 125 = - 25 \text{ (surplus)} $

> $ \text{Exports } = 30 \\
\text{Imports } = 0.1 \times 500 = 50 \\
\textbf{Trade Balance } = 30 - 50 = -20 \text{ (deficit)} $

d) A money market is formed in Utopia, and the central bank sets the interest rate. Discuss the effectiveness of monetary policy in Utopia as a means of stimulating the economy. Discuss with reference to the IS-LM framework. [10 marks]  

> In Utopia, investment is fixed at 80 irrespective of economic output or interest rate. As such, the introduction of money markets would not change the aggregate demand schedule. With reference to the IS-LM framework, we may consider interest rates to be vertical (as set by the central bank) and LM to be horizontal (having no sensitivity to interest rates).

<br>

### Question 14

Researchland has a labour force $ (LF) $ of 50 million people. Of these, 5 million are unemployed $ (U) $, and the rest employed $ (E) $. The rate of job loss for those in work is $ j = 0.05 $, whereas the hiring rate for those without jobs is $ h = 0.95 $.

a) Explain what the natural rate of unemployment is and derive an expression for it in terms of $j$ and $h$. Find the natural rate of unemployment in Researchland. [10 marks]

> **The natural rate of unemployment represents the level of unemployment that exists when the labor market is in equilibrium. This rate includes only frictional and structural unemployment, excluding cyclical unemployment caused by economic fluctuations.**

> $
E_i = hE_{i-1} + hU_{i-1} \\
U_i = jE_{i-1} + jU_{i-1} \\~\\
E_{i-1} = \frac{U_i - jU_{i-1}}{j} = \frac{1}{j} U_i - U_{i-1} \\
E_i = h(\frac{1}{j} U_i - U_{i-1}) + hU_{i-1} = \frac{h}{j}U_i \\~\\
LF = E+U = \frac{h}{j}U + U \\
U = \frac{j}{j+h}LF \; \& \; NRU = \frac{j}{j+h}\\~\\
\therefore U = \frac{1}{20}LF = 2.5 \text{ million } \& \; NRU = 5\%
$

b) Is unemployment in Researchland at the natural rate? If not, will unemployment converge to the natural rate over time? [10 marks]

> The present number of unemployed people is greater than the steady state and thus we expect unemployment rate (presently 10\%) to trend downwards and converge to the natural rate of 5\%.

c) The wide adoption of Microsoft Teams, Zoom, and similar technologies in the workplace have made it easier for employees to work remotely for part of the week, thereby adding greater flexibility to their ability to manage family responsibilities. Discuss what the likely effect of this on the labour force and thus on the labour market. [10 marks]

> Greater accessibility to work should result in a greater labour participation rate, increasing the size of the labour force. For the existing workers, a better work life balance could mean a reduced rate of job loss $h$. For employers, the increased availability of office space could mean an increased hiring rate $j$. Given the increase of worker availability, we may expect salaries to go down, at least in the short run.
